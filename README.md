## PyCity Schools Analysis

Within main.py are the calculations to correlate student's performance on standardized reading and math exams across 15 schools with the amount of dollars allocated per student, whether the school is a charter or within a district and size of the school.

Upon studying the dataframe "spending_summary", one finds that the increase of the dollar amount allocated per student does not improve test scores or increase the percentage of students who passed both standardized math and reading exam.

Another conclusion can be drawn from studying the dataframe "type_summary" which shows charter schools have a much higher success rate of their students passing both standardized math and reading exam (90.43%) compared to students who hail from schools that are within districts (53.67%). This is mostly due to a large gap between the percentage of students who passed the standardized math exam in schools within disticts (66.55%) and those from charter schools (93.62%).

Finally, it can be inferred that schools with a large student population (2000-5000) are at a disadvantage with having their students pass both standardized exams (58.29%) compared to the success rate of schools with a small (>1000) student population (89.88%) or medium (1000-2000) student population (90.62%).
